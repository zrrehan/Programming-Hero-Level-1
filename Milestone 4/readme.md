# Milestone 4 - JavaScript Basics  

## Module 17: Introduction to JavaScript  
In this module, we explored the fundamentals of JavaScript, including syntax, variables, data types, and basic operations. This serves as the foundation for writing and understanding JavaScript code.  

## Module 18: Conditional Statements (if-else)  
We learned about conditional statements such as `if`, `else if`, and `else`, which help in making decisions within the code. These concepts are essential for controlling program flow based on different conditions.  

## Module 18.5: Arrays (Part 1)  
This module introduced arrays, one of the most important data structures in JavaScript. We covered array creation, indexing, and basic operations like adding and removing elements.  

## Module 19: Loops (for, while)  
Loops allow us to execute code repeatedly. In this module, we learned about `for` loops, `while` loops, and `do-while` loops to iterate over arrays, perform repetitive tasks, and enhance efficiency.  

## Module 20: Strings & Objects  
We explored strings and string manipulation techniques using built-in methods. Additionally, we covered objects—one of the core data structures in JavaScript—learning how to create, access, and manipulate them.  

## Module 21: Functions  
Functions allow us to write reusable blocks of code. This module covered function declaration, parameters, return values, and function expressions. We also explored arrow functions and function scope.  

## Module 22: Problem Solving (Part 1)  
This module introduced fundamental problem-solving techniques using JavaScript. We practiced solving simple problems to build logic and enhance our programming skills.  

## Module 23: Problem Solving (Part 2)  
We continued our problem-solving journey, tackling more complex problems using loops, conditionals, and functions. This module reinforced logical thinking and algorithmic approaches.
