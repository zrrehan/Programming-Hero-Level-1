# Milestone 5: DOM Manipulation and Event Listener

## Module 25: Tour of DOM
In this module, we explored the fundamentals of the Document Object Model (DOM). We learned how to navigate, select, and manipulate elements dynamically using JavaScript. Key topics covered included:
- Selecting elements using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll`
- Modifying element properties, attributes, and styles
- Creating and appending new elements to the DOM
- Understanding the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`

## Module 26: Event Handling
Building upon our DOM knowledge, this module introduced event handling in JavaScript. We learned how to:
- Add event listeners using `addEventListener()`
- Handle user interactions such as clicks, keypresses, and form submissions
- Use `event.target` to determine the source of an event
- Implement event delegation for better performance


## Module 27 + 28: Payoo Banking App
In these modules, we applied our knowledge of DOM manipulation and event handling to build a functional banking application. The "Payoo Banking App" project involved:
- Creating an interactive UI for deposits, withdrawals, and balance updates
- Handling form submissions and updating the UI dynamically
- Implementing input validation and error handling
- Storing and retrieving data dynamically within the app
