        "details": "Public health experts in Bangladesh are raising concerns about the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance, which poses a significant threat to the effective treatment of common infections. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both human and animal healthcare are identified as key contributing factors to this growing problem. Experts are advocating for stricter regulations on antibiotic prescriptions, public awareness campaigns on the responsible use of antibiotics, and enhanced surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Failure to address this issue could lead to a situation where many bacterial infections become untreatable, increasing morbidity and mortality rates. Collaborative efforts involving healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public are crucial to combat the rise of antibiotic resistance.",
